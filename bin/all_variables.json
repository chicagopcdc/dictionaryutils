Because carboplatin has been shown to be effective in pediatric MGCT with less toxicity, the TIP regimen was modified by substituting carboplatin for cisplatin.

Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation during the post-translational modification of small GTPase signalling proteins, which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover. Decreased bone turnover and stabilization of the bone matrix contribute to the analgesic effect of zoledronic acid with respect to painful osteoblastic tumors.

It is composed predominantly of lymphocytes and fewer epithelial cells. Connective tissue septa separate the lobes into lobules. The lobules contain an outer portion (cortical zone) which is rich in lymphocytes and an inner portion (medullary zone) which is rich in epithelial cells. It is an organ essential for the development of the immune system. Its function is the maturation of the progenitor lymphoid cells to thymocytes and subsequently to mature T-cells. It reaches its greatest weight at puberty and subsequently begins to involute.": [

Upon administration and internalization by CD30-positive tumor cells, brentuximab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage, releasing MMAE into the cytosol; MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization, which may result in G2/M phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. Transiently activated during lymphocyte activation, CD30 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8;TNFRSF8) may be constitutively expressed in hematologic malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma and some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Some types make the stomach smaller, which decreases the amount of food that it can hold so the person feels full sooner and eats less. Other types make changes to the stomach and the small intestine, which decreases the nutrients and calories that are absorbed from food. Weight loss surgery can improve many obesity-related health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, unhealthy cholesterol levels, sleep apnea, and knee, hip, or other body pain. Having weight loss surgery may also decrease the risk of some cancers, including endometrial cancer. Also called bariatric surgery. (Source: NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms)": [
